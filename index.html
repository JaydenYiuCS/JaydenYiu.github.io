                    <p>
                        My name is Jayden Yiu and as mentioned before, I am a grade 10 student attending UHS. Since a young age, 
                        I have loved learning about STEM and have participated in various competitions and clubs to further my 
                        knowledge and skills. I have many experiences in coding, robotics, and other STEM-related activities.
                        I am part of the UHS Robotics team, the Markham firebirds robotics team, the UHS Computer Science club, and have 
                        participated in many STEM related competitions such as the Canadian Computing Competition and the Pascal Math Contest. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am a Canadian immigrant from Hong Kong who has lived in Canada for 4 years. I am fluent in English, Cantonese, and Mandarin.
                        In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, modding video games, playing the piano, programming websites and applications, and solving coding problems on leetCode.
                        As mentioned before, I am currently participating in the STEM program at UHS, which includes activities such as robotics, Computer Designing and Computer Science.
                        I am also a member of the programming part of the UHS Robotics team, where I help make the autonomous routines and other programming related tasks.
                        I have experience with various programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
